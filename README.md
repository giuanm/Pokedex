## Pokedex
	I developed the Pokedex during a DIO bootcamp. The task had the objective of consulting an API with more than 1000 pokemons, rendering a limited list, adding a new list up to a limit of less than 1000 and when selecting a pokemon, a screen would be rendered with the most detailed information about that pokemon.
